# TripAdvisor-Analyser
Create an excel file with Restaurant datas from TripAdvisor. Name, link, stars and reviews. Download all review of a city.

Command:

python3 "Analisi TripAdvisor.py"  

It will ask you for link of city like that:
https://www.tripadvisor.it/Restourants-g1933367-Mondaino_Province_of_Rimini_Emilia_Romagna-Vacations.html

It will create a new file excel called "risultati.xlsx" with datas of all restaurants.

After that you can download all reviews from that city with command:

python3 "ottieni recensioni.py"

Remember that this last operation is very slow and can take long time.

At the end it will create a file called recensioni.txt where are saved all reviews of the city.
